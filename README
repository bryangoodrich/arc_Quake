The code here is a Python script loadable into ArcGIS that makes dynamic use of the USGS earthquake georss feeds located at

http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/catalogs/

There are feeds for the past hour, day, week, or month, provided in ATOM, RSS 2.0, or CSV formats. This script utilizes the RSS version that provide the most information--i.e., the lowest restriction by magnitude size for a given feed class. 

When converted into an ArcGIS tool, the interface should include an option for which feed to use. The script then uses the appropriate XML document to access that feed, extract the relevant information (lat, long, depth, time, etc.), and convert it at that moment into a timestamped point feature class. 

The idea is that this will allow users to quickly access the spatial information provided by USGS within their GIS. In ArcMap 10, you can simply load any of the online basemaps and symbolize the feature class as desired to begin getting an idea about the events. This script can easily be modified or used as is with an intended protocol to allow the user to build their own running database of these phenomena.
