Most people using internet technology today have come across an RSS feed. 
These are what drive twitter feeds, blogs, and news. The RSS (or ATOM) 
standard let these generated XML documents be easily incorporated by any
designed aggregator. The design of GeoRSS is simple: include XML namespace
for spatial geometry. This Python script is designed to handle the USGS 
earthquake GeoRSS by being an aggregator that creates an aggregation via a
feature class for ArcGIS. When the user selects an already existing feature
class, the behavior is to update the feature with the new information not 
already contained within. There is a flag to overwrite the class to begin a
fresh aggregation.

The USGS earthquake feeds are listed here.
